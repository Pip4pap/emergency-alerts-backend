Seeding databases
-> Databases can be seeded in development, test and production mode.
-> To seed the databases, rely on the configuration in the /models/config/config.json file in the project folder.
-> When seeding the database in development and test mode, you must first create the databse according to the name in /models/config/config.json.
-> When seeding the database in production mode, note that the production will be wiped clean.
